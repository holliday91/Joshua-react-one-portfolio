## Technical Skills

Throughout my professional experience, I have developed a set of durable skills that have contributed to my growth as a software engineer. Here are some of the key skills I have acquired:

### React and React-Redux

I have extensive experience working with React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. I have utilized React to create dynamic and responsive web applications, leveraging its component-based architecture and virtual DOM. Additionally, I have employed React-Redux, a state management library, to efficiently manage application state and facilitate seamless data flow between components.

### Tailwind CSS

In my projects, I have leveraged Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework, to rapidly prototype and build user interfaces. Tailwind CSS provides a comprehensive set of pre-designed utility classes, enabling me to quickly customize and style components without writing extensive CSS code.

### JavaScript

I have sharpened my JavaScript skills throughout my professional journey. JavaScript is a fundamental language in web development, and I have utilized it extensively to build interactive and dynamic web applications. I have a deep understanding of JavaScript concepts, syntax, and best practices, allowing me to write clean and efficient code.

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

I have a strong foundation in object-oriented programming principles. This paradigm has allowed me to design and develop scalable, modular, and maintainable software systems. I am adept at implementing OOP concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to create robust and flexible code structures.

### Kubernetes and Docker

I have been exposed to using Kubernetes and Docker as part of my projects. These containerization technologies have provided me with the ability to deploy and manage applications efficiently in a scalable and isolated environment. I am familiar with containerization concepts, orchestration, and deploying applications using Kubernetes, as well as creating Docker containers for streamlined development and deployment processes.

### Okta Authentication

In my work, I have integrated Okta authentication into web applications to enhance security and user management. I have experience implementing Okta's authentication and authorization features, including user authentication, single sign-on (SSO), and access control. This expertise has allowed me to develop secure and reliable authentication systems for web applications.

These durable skills have played a significant role in my professional growth and have equipped me to tackle diverse challenges in software engineering. I am continuously expanding my skill set and staying up-to-date with the latest technologies to deliver innovative and efficient solutions.
