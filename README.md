## Overview

Hello there! Welcome to my README. I am a software engineer currently working at McKinsey & Company. I am also an apprentice at Multiverse. This document will provide you with some insights into my background, experience, and skills.

## Experience

During my time at McKinsey & Company, I have been part of the feedback frontend team. Working on this team has allowed me to gain valuable experience in frontend development, particularly in the context of feedback systems. I have been involved in designing and implementing user interfaces, collaborating with designers and backend developers to create seamless user experiences.

## Skills

### Leadership

Working in a team environment has given me the opportunity to develop and enhance my leadership skills. I have learned how to effectively communicate with team members, delegate tasks, and coordinate efforts to achieve project goals. I believe that strong leadership is crucial in delivering high-quality software products.

### Technical Skills

My experience as a software engineer has enabled me to strengthen my frontend and backend development skills. On the frontend, I have expertise in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as frameworks such as React. On the backend, I have worked with technologies like Node.js, Express, and databases such as MySQL and SQL.

### Non-technical Skills

In addition to technical skills, I have also focused on developing non-technical skills that are vital for success in the software engineering field. These skills include effective communication, problem-solving, critical thinking, and adaptability. I believe that a well-rounded skill set is essential in tackling complex challenges and delivering innovative solutions.
